###Background

I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Hawaii at Manoa and a M.S. in Electrical Engineering-Computer Networks from the University of Southern California.  Before my career truly started, I debated whether to  pursue Network Engineering, Systems Administration, or Software Engineering.  I eventually chose Software Engineering because of the creative and problem solving aspects as well as the mental stimulation it provided.  I do sometimes wear the other two
hats, but software development will always be my main passion.

###Coding is What I do

Throughout my career, I have worked with many programming languages and technology stacks.  I journeyed through different industries including Defense, Entertainment, Web, and Finance.  C++ was my primary weapon, but these days I am enjoying coding in Ruby and learning some Go when I have the chance.  

###Current State

After spending the majority of my career in Los Angeles, I returned home to Honolulu, HI working for Ikayzo, an interactive design and software engineering service company.  My current project is working on market data infrastructure for a large financial company located in NYC and Newport Beach.
